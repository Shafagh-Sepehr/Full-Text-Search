Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinicalbiochemical, or histologic evidence of liver disease, or they may have chronipersistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellulacarcinomaMost cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) are probably the result oa viral infection, although in a good number of cases the cause cannot bdetermined. The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy. Iconsists of findings of portal inflammation, an intact periportal limitinplate, and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. But in contrasto chronic active hepatitis (CAH) there is no periportal inflammation,bridging necrosis, or fibrosis.CPH has, indeed, an excellent prognosis. If I had to choose between CAH anCPH there is no question I would also choose CPH. However, as David pointeout, the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would havit. The histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal, with biopsies showinareas compatible with both CPH and CAH. Maybe it is a sampling problem. Maybit is a continuum.
